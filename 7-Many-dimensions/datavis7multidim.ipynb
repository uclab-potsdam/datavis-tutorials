Wikipedia's sister Wikidata is a particularly broad knowledge base that can be queried using the query language SPARQL. The query syntax may seem a bit daunting, which is because it operates on the basis of triples representing semantic relationships binding entities. In this tutorial, we will not go deeper into the syntax, but it may already help to visit the web-based interface to the [Wikidata query service](https://query.wikidata.org).\n","\n","Queries against Wikidata can be directly issued from the comfort of your notebook using HTTP requests! For this we need the `requests` library again, the URL of the endpoint and the SPARQL query. The following query requests three bits of information about European countries: `gdp`, `area` and `population`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"cell_id":"47f4f460201543bd8c3b431433608289","colab":{},"colab_type":"code","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":620,"execution_start":1685638023533,"id":"JEEafSMsEsmn","source_hash":"a31dab32"},"outputs":[],"source":["import requests\n","import requests_cache # this package creates a local cache, which speeds things up quite a bit\n","\n","# set up cache for web requests\n","requests_cache.install_cache('cache')\n","\n","endpoint = \"https://query.wikidata.org/sparql\"\n","\n","# triple quotes start and end multi-line strings\n","sparql = \"\"\"\n","SELECT ?countryLabel ?population ?gdp ( MAX(?areas) AS ?area )\n","WHERE {\n","  ?country wdt:P31 wd:Q3624078;\n","           wdt:P463 wd:Q458;\n","           wdt:P1082 ?population;\n","           wdt:P8744/wdt:P2131 ?gdp;\n","           p:P2046/psn:P2046/wikibase:quantityAmount ?areas.\n","  \n","  ?gdp_statement ps:P2131 ?gdp;\n","                pq:P585 ?gdp_date. \n","\n","  FILTER NOT EXISTS {\n","    ?country p:P2131/pq:P585 ?gdp_date_ .\n","    FILTER (?gdp_date_ > ?gdp_date)\n","  }\n","  \n","  SERVICE wikibase:label {\n","    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" .\n","  }\n","}\n","\n","GROUP BY ?countryLabel ?area ?population ?gdp\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","res = requests.get(endpoint, params = {'format': 'json', 'query': sparql})\n","response = res.text"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"cell_id":"301a2e575ee44cab8cf81a12b539f7ff","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":680},"colab_type":"code","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"executionInfo":{"elapsed":14118,"status":"ok","timestamp":1598368484343,"user":{"displayName":"Marian D√∂rk","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhqiajTdRS6NXELnqFzS3NNM3uxy6nUDGSMCjvAjw=s64","userId":"05248840544598202773"},"user_tz":-120},"execution_millis":4,"execution_start":1685638024179,"id":"TxYbuiRckC-n","outputId":"f19f7fd2-d204-4ffe-85de-f2b0935c08ec","source_hash":"9512c61a"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["{\n","  \"head\" : {\n","    \"vars\" : [ \"countryLabel\", \"population\", \"gdp\", \"area\" ]\n","  },\n","  \"results\" : {\n","    \"bindings\" : [ {\n","      \"countryLabel\" : {\n","        \"xml:lang\" : \"en\",\n","        \"type\" : \"literal\",\n","        \"value\" : \"Finland\"\n","      },\n","      \"area\" : {\n","        \"datatype\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal\",\n","        \"type\" : \"literal\",\n","        \"value\" : \"390905420000\"\n","      },\n","      \"population\" : {\n","        \"datatype\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal\",\n","        \"type\" : \"literal\",\n","        \"value\" : \"5516224\"\n","      },\n","      \"gdp\" : {\n","        \"datatype\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal\",\n","        \"type\" : \"literal\",\n","        \"value\" : \"251884887972.766\"\n","      }\n","    }, {\n","      \"countryLabel\" : {\n","        \"xml:lang\" : \"en\",\n","        \"type\" : \"literal\",\n","        \"value\" : \"Croatia\"\n","      },\n","      \"area\" : {\n","        \"datatype\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal\",\n","        \"type\" : \"literal\",\n","        \"value\" : \"56594000000\"\n","      },\n","      \"population\" : {\n","      \n"]}],"source":["print(response[:1000])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"b032214cf6384770b4baa18a78b313a7","colab_type":"text","deepnote_cell_height":74,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"TF5MNVsYphlp"},"source":["The query might take a bit of time to finish (a minute or so), which is due to the various attributes that are queried.
